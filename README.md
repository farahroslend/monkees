# The Monkees

all 3 medias/viewport classes; desktop, iPad and mobile devices.

Through this website that is engineered to be as visually pleasing and intuitive as possible, 
the user will be able to:

* Be introduced to the Monkees,
* Find out interesting details about the 4 bandmates,

* Know their tour schedule and make requests for booking availabilities,
* Get updates about the Monkees' latest development on social medias.
